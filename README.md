App Idea: GenZ Brain 

It is apparent that the Gen Z generation has fallen victim to short term attention spans through short burst of video entertainment like TikTok. In order to take advantage of this new mode of attention. I think that it would be pretty interesting to try and create a productivity app that tailors your workload to short burst that are filled with fun videos. This would hope to combat the fatigue of working long hours and create an ejoyable experience as well. Potential features would be video curation, workspace customization and friends.
